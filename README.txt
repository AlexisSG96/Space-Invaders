Project: Space Invaders

The purpose of this project was to attempt to clone the retro Space Invaders game. This was done using the code
from the Alien Invasion game. This version includes features such as animated aliens, animated deaths for objects,
a high score system, and bunkers that deteriorate as they get hit.
